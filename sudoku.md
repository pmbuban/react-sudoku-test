### Coding Challenge

Write a [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) app in React or React Native.

The details of gameplay and user interface is up to you, but at a minimum there needs to be a way to start a new game and show success/error message based on user inputs.

The submission should be a complete project with installation / compilation documentation.

The expectation is that the challenge will take no more that 4 to 5 hours to complete.

You will not be judged on the UI, and we are mostly interested in seeing well structured code.

If any part is taking an unreasonable amount of time, feel free to leave it unfinished and document what could not be completed and why.
