## Original task 

### Coding Challenge

Write a [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) app in React or React Native.

The details of gameplay and user interface is up to you, but at a minimum there needs to be a way to start a new game and show success/error message based on user inputs.

The submission should be a complete project with installation / compilation documentation.

The expectation is that the challenge will take no more that 4 to 5 hours to complete.

You will not be judged on the UI, and we are mostly interested in seeing well structured code.

If any part is taking an unreasonable amount of time, feel free to leave it unfinished and document what could not be completed and why.


## Installation
- ensure that `node` and `npm` are installed
- navigate to the project folder and run `npm install`
- after installation is complete run `npm start`
- navigate your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`
- the project is based off of the `create-react-app` repository developed by Facebook 

## How to play
- default values are not editable
- blank boxes are capable of handling numbers 1-9
- each row and column should have unique numbers
- hit validate to see if there are errors in your solution
- hit reset to start a new game

## Things I could not complete due to time constraints
- creating a random game board
- validating 3x3 squares
- creating a success message once game is completed without errors
